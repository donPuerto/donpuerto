### Hi there 👋

I'm a full stack developer with a focus on Supabase, Flutter, and Vue.js. Currently, I'm working on Revival Group and continually learning to keep up with the latest technologies.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on Flutter Project using Supabase
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Supabase, Flutter, Vue 

“As Albert Einstein said, "Life is like riding a bicycle. To keep your balance, you must keep moving." I believe in continuous learning and growth, and I'm excited about the opportunities that lie ahead.”
